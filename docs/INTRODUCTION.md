# Introduction

Welcome to **Baruk DeFi 2.0 — The Holo-Neon UI**.

This documentation hub describes the all-new, ultra-intuitive interface that blends the aesthetics of sci-fi control rooms with the approachability of a children’s storybook.

> “If your toddler can explore it and your inner-agent loves it, we’ve done our job.”

What’s inside:

1. **Why a complete redesign?**  
   • Deliver a friction-free crypto experience.  
   • Bridge the gap between advanced DeFi power-users and absolute beginners.  
   • Remove intimidating Web3 jargon.
2. **Core principles**  
   • _Simplicity_: No page requires more than one decision at a time.  
   • _Guided Focus_: Neon accents highlight the single next action.  
   • _Accessibility_: Large touch-targets, high-contrast colours, full keyboard & screen-reader coverage.
3. **How to use this GitBook**  
   Each chapter can be read stand-alone. Skim the Quick Start if you want to run the app locally, or jump straight to the UI Design section for component guidelines.

Happy building — and may your trades always be in the green glow!
